# Demo Stream Deck Plugin

This is a advanced demo plugin built with the NodeJS SDK Of StreamDeck.
I built this plugin in this Youtube tutorial series: ['Playlist'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz56mx7eJkc&list=PLUv2R7fQV7GWLUsl9JgyPMfDmsc0KIurr)


The Plugin will give the following examples:

- How to implement a Key action
- How to implement a Dial action
- What is the manifest.json
- How to set images onto a Stream Deck key using the SDK
- How to add the Property Inspector
